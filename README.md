Controlling a Raspberry Pi based robot with a website. Still in very early alpha.
Current features:
- No web
  - Motor Control
  - Camera Picture
- Plain Flask
  - Motor Control (with arrow keys or buttons)
  - Camera Picture (by refreshing the page, you get a new picture)
- Flask and Socket IO

Many of these scripts have little to no documentation, comments, installation/recreation guides, but will soon be!
